            <h1 style="text-align: center;">JDM</h1>
            <b>JDM</b> stands for <b>Japanese Domestic Market</b>, referring to vehicles and auto parts produced specifically for sale within Japan. These are not meant for export, and often differ in design, specifications, and performance compared to their international counterparts.Importantly, not all Japanese cars are JDM. A Toyota Corolla sold in the U.S. isn’t JDM, even though it’s a Japanese brand. A true JDM vehicle is built for and sold exclusively in the Japanese market — typically featuring right-hand drive, metric gauges, and sometimes higher-spec performance parts than global models.

            <h1 style="text-align: center;">Famous cars</h1>
            <h2 style="text-align: center;">Nissan Skyline GT-R</h2>
                The Nissan Skyline GT-R is more than just a car — it’s a symbol of Japanese automotive excellence. From its roots as a modest sedan to its evolution into a global motorsport monster, the GT-R has become an icon, loved by tuners, racers, collectors, and car culture fans around the world. Known for advanced technology, bulletproof engines, and record-shattering performance, the GT-R carved its place in history through a relentless pursuit of speed and innovation.The Skyline name began with Prince Motor Company in the 1950s. When Prince merged with Nissan in 1966, the Skyline series continued under the Nissan badge. Early Skylines were modest sedans, but Nissan engineers soon saw the potential for performance.

            <h1 style="text-align: center;">What makes them different?</h1>
            <h2 style="text-align: center;">Cars' perfomance</h2>
            One of the most noticeable differences is performance and engine tuning. Many JDM models were engineered with more aggressive tuning from the factory. For instance, JDM variants of performance cars like the Subaru WRX STI or Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution often came with higher-output engines compared to the versions sold in North America or Europe. Sometimes, Japan-exclusive engines were installed altogether, like the RB26DETT in the Nissan Skyline GT-R or the 1JZ-GTE in the Toyota Chaser — powerplants not found in export versions. Japanese emissions regulations were once less strict than those in the U.S. or EU, allowing manufacturers to tune engines for sharper throttle response and more torque. Most JDM cars were also electronically limited to 180 km/h (112 mph) due to Japanese law, but this limiter was easily removed by enthusiasts.
            <hr>
            <h2 style="text-align: center;">Mechanical features</h2>
            Mechanically, JDM cars sometimes featured different transmission and drivetrain options not available in exported models. Some JDM versions came with manual transmissions that were never offered abroad. Certain models even had AWD or RWD configurations exclusive to the Japanese market. Suspension setups and limited-slip differentials could also differ, giving JDM cars more spirited handling or firmer, track-focused tuning straight from the factory.
            <hr>
            <h2 style="text-align: center;">Tuning</h2>
            Styling is another major area of difference. JDM cars often received unique body kits, wheels, spoilers, and exterior details. For example, the JDM versions of the Honda Integra Type R or Nissan Silvia featured more aggressive bumpers or factory aero parts not seen in international models. Lighting systems also varied: JDM vehicles typically had different headlights, taillights, or side indicators tailored to Japan’s road rules and trends. Mirror-mounted turn signals and high-intensity discharge (HID) headlights were common in Japan long before they became standard globally.
            <hr>
            <h2 style="text-align: center;">Uniqueness</h2>
            Inside the cabin, JDM cars almost always came as right-hand drive (RHD), since Japan drives on the left side of the road. The instrument cluster is in kilometers per hour, and temperatures are displayed in Celsius. Beyond that, many JDM models included interior features and technology well ahead of their time. Factory-installed digital climate control, touch-screen navigation systems, heated seats, and multi-function displays were commonly found in Japanese-market models years before those features became widespread in other countries. Some high-performance JDM models, like the Nissan R34 GT-R, even came with live performance telemetry displays that showed boost pressure, lap times, oil temperature, and more — all from the dashboard.

            The Toyota Supra MK4, officially known as the Toyota Supra A80, is one of the most legendary Japanese sports cars of all time. Produced between 1993 and 2002 (1993–1998 for the North American market), it was built on Toyota’s A platform and designed by Isao Tsuzuki. The car was offered as a sleek 2-door coupe, with some models featuring a removable targa top for an open-air experience. It belongs to the sports car and grand tourer (GT) class and quickly became a favorite among enthusiasts for its performance, styling, and tuning potential.

            The Mazda RX-7 is a high-performance sports car built by Mazda between 1978 and 2002. It's one of the most iconic Japanese sports cars ever made — not just because of its sleek looks and sharp handling, but because of what lives under the hood: a rotary engine.Instead of using a conventional piston engine like most cars, the RX-7 uses a Wankel rotary engine — a small, high-revving unit that delivers smooth, linear power in a compact package. This unusual engine choice helped the RX-7 achieve a near-perfect weight balance, giving it exceptional agility and making it a favorite among drivers, racers, and tuners.

            <img src="https://i.ibb.co/JwNZPCHZ/silvia1.jpg" width="300px">
            The Nissan Silvia is a legendary line of compact sports coupes produced by Nissan from 1964 to 2002, across seven generations. What began as a stylish, hand-built GT evolved into one of the most iconic tuner and drift platforms in the world. Most enthusiasts associate the Silvia name with the S-chassis cars (S13, S14, S15), which earned cult status in Japan and around the world for their perfect balance of performance, affordability, and tuning potential.The original Silvia was a luxury sports coupe based on the Datsun Fairlady platform. It had a handcrafted body and was very rare — only about 550 units were made. It wasn’t a performance car like later models, but it introduced the Silvia name.
            <img src="https://i.ibb.co/DDhV8mMK/ae86-levin-2-1.jpg" width="300px">
            Toyota AE86 was produced from 1983 to 1987 and is officially known as the Toyota Corolla Levin (coupe) and Toyota Sprinter Trueno (hatchback). It used the chassis code AE86. The car had a front-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout and weighed about 950 kg. It came with a 1.6-liter 4A-GE inline-four DOHC 16-valve engine producing around 128 horsepower and about 110 lb-ft of torque. Most models had a 5-speed manual gearbox, though some had a 4-speed automatic. Stock top speed was around 200 km/h and 0–100 km/h acceleration was about 8.5 seconds.It became legendary for its lightweight chassis, high-revving naturally aspirated engine, and analog driving feel with no driver aids. It gained fame in drift culture and Japanese mountain pass racing, especially through the Initial D manga and anime.
